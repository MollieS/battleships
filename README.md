Task:

Deliver a working model of the Battleships game, focussing on Single Responsibilty in classes and trying to limit dependency in tests and production code.

To do:

1.  Add unit tests for:
  1. Ensure that vertical and horizontal positioning affect ship placement on board
  2. Ensure that ship cannot be placed outside of the board
  3. Allow ships to be sunk
2.  Make sure all user stories so far have been met fully in relation to the expansion of the grid
3.  Continue working on the next user stories
4.  Refactor to make code cleaner and more readible

Completed so far:
1. On a one square grid, a player can:
  1. Place a ship
  2. Fire at a ship
